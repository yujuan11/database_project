### List of GTK bad time stamps for run 10921
### Following events are identified as not optimal for GigaTracker:
### - events at the end of the frame (appear every 6.4us)
### - events that appear every 400 ns
### Event time stamps are defined in bins of trigger time stamp (TS) % 256.
### End of the frame is provided by the first and last affected TS%256 bins
### as multiple consecutive events are lost.
### Periodic inefficiency is defined by the first TS%256 bin,
### and it affects 2 bins of TS%256 out of every 16 bins.
### File format:
### PeriodicLossBinStart= GTK0bin GTK1bin GTK2bin GTK3bin
### EoFLossBinStart= GTK0bin GTK1bin GTK2bin GTK3bin
### EoFLossBinEnd= GTK0bin GTK1bin GTK2bin GTK3bin
