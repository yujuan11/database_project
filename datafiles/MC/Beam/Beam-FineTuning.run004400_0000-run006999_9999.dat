# Bend6 field scale factor determines the beam dy/dz.
# The sensitivity is d(dy/dz) / d(ScaleFactor) = -0.0165.
# So increasing the scale factor by 0.0001 decreases dy/dz by 1.65 microrad.
#
# Trim5 field scale factor determines the beam dx/dz.
# The sensitivity is d(dx/dz) / d(ScaleFactor) = 0.0012.
# So increasing the scale factor by 0.001 increases dx/dz by 1.2 microrad.
