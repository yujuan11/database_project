# An example of "external mode" NA62MC input file.
# One primary particle per event must be specified. Each line encodes one event.
# If fewer events are simulated than the number of lines, lines are taken at random.
# If more events than lines are requested, the number of events is capped at the number of lines.
# Format: PDG code, x y z [mm], Px Py Pz [MeV].
